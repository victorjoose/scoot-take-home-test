    <h2>About: Scoot Take-home Test</h2>
    <h4>Hello there! This is the Scoot Take-home Test. I've built a simple to-do list for you. You can easily add, edit,
        and delete tasks. You can also see your tasks and filter them by their descriptions and priority levels. Plus, I
        used NodeJs to save your tasks in a JSON file. Enjoy!</h4>
